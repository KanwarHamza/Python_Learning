# Data visalization
data ---------> Plot
plot usually consist of x and y axis which is called a graph

There are several forms of graphs like scatter plot, bar plot, histogram, line plot, pie chart, box plot, stacked bark Plot etc.
These x axis and y axis are made up on two variables which are called data points and these are called coordinates

lets say (x,y)=(3,4)
import draw as data
data.plot(3,4)


where x=weight
y=height

or x= food
y= weight

food= 35, 10, 25, 40
weight= 60, 70, 75, 80
The marks that depicts each of the position on a graph is called tick marks

bar plot is used to show the comparison between two or more variables
histogram is used to show the distribution of a single variable
line plot is used to show the trend of a variable over time
pie chart is used to show the proportion of a variable in a whole
box plot is used to show the distribution of a variable in terms of quartiles
stacked bar plot is used to show the comparison between two or more variables in a single bar
scatter plot is used to show the relationship between two variables
other types of plots are used to show the relationship between two or more variables in a single plot such as heatmap, contour plot, 3D plot etc.
