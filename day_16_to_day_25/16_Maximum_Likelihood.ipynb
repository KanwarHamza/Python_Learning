    "Maximum likelihood estimation is a common approach used for parameter estimation in statistical models. Here are the key aspects of maximum likelihood:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Given a statistical model with parameters and some data, the method estimates the set of parameters that maximize the likelihood or probability of observing the given data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Likelihood is the conditional probability of obtaining the sample data given the parameters of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Maximizing likelihood finds the parameters that make the observed data most probable or likely.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example, in linear regression the parameters (slope, intercept) that maximize the Gaussian likelihood of the residuals are estimated.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Common methods used for maximization include iterative procedures like gradient ascent.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In statistics, maximum likelihood produces consistent, efficient and asymptotically normal estimates under regularity conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Used widely in building probabilistic models like logistic regression, Naive Bayes, mixture models etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Provides natural way to estimate structured probabilistic models with latent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Objectively evaluates which parameter values best “explain” the data without making prior assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in summary, maximum likelihood is a principled way to estimate parameters of statistical distributions from observed data in an objective, model-consistent manner."
