        "\n",
        "🤔 Activation Functions are an important part of Neural Networks!\n",
        "\n",
        "🧠 Each neuron in a neural network performs a simple operation on the numbers it receives as input. But for the network to learn, the output must vary slightly with the inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "💡 This is where Activation Functions come in! They introduce nonlinearity to allow the network to learn complex patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "😀 The most common one is the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU). It outputs the input directly if it is positive, but outputs 0 if the input is negative: f(x) = max(0,x)\n",
        "\n",
        "😮 This lets outputs grow as inputs increase, but doesn’t grow without limit like other functions. It adds just the right amount of nonlinearity!\n",
        "\n",
        "🤓 sigmoid and tanh are also popular. Sigmoid squashes numbers between 0-1: f(x)=1/(1+e-x) Tanh maps to -1 to 1: f(x)=2σ(x)-1\n",
        "\n",
        "😎 These “squash” outputs to control growth and prevent exploding or vanishing values during training.\n",
        "\n",
        "🥳 With activation functions introducing nonlinearity, neural networks can learn incredibly complex patterns just like our amazing brains! 🧠\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are some common types of activation functions used in TensorFlow:\n",
        "\n",
        "💪 Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU): f(x) = max(0, x)\n",
        "\n",
        "    Most widely used activation function. Works well for both shallow and deep networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "🙂 Sigmoid: f(x) = 1/(1+e-x)\n",
        "\n",
        "    Squashes the output to range between 0-1. Used for probability predictions in the output layer.\n",
        "\n",
        "🤙 Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent): f(x) = (e^x – e^-x)/(e^x + e^-x)\n",
        "\n",
        "    Squashes output to range -1 to 1. ReLU often works better than tanh in hidden layers.\n",
        "\n",
        "🤓 Softmax: f(x)_i = e^{x_i} / ∑_j e^{x_j}\n",
        "\n",
        "    Used for multi-class classification where the outputs represent class probabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "😎 Leaky ReLU: f(x) = max(αx, x) where α is a small positive value like 0.01\n",
        "\n",
        "    Solves the “dying ReLU” problem where a unit may stop learning if its input is negative.\n",
        "\n",
        "😎 ELU (Exponential Linear Unit): f(x) = x for x > 0, f(x) = α(e^x – 1) for x < 0\n",
        "\n",
        "    Slightly better than ReLU by allowing negative values close to zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "So in summary, ReLU, sigmoid, tanh are commonly used in hidden layers while softmax is popular in output layers for classification tasks."

Right now our data is 28x28 images, and 28 layers of 28 neurons would be infeasible, so it makes more sense to 'flatten' that 28,28 into a 784x1. Instead of writng all the code to handle that ourselves, we add the Flatten() layer at the begining, and when the arrays are loaded into the model later, they'll automatically be flattened for us.\n",
