This is a 40 days code challenge. I am going to write code in different programming languages and share it with you. I will also share my experience and knowledge with you.\

- Day 2
- Day 3

>### Numbering of lists

1. Day 1
2. Day 2
3. Day 3
4. Day 4

# 10-Adding code or code block

To print a string use `print("Hamza")`
we use backtick to print code block.

If we want to add a code block we use three backticks. Here is an example:

```
x=5+6
y= 8-3
z=4*5
a=x+y+z
print (z)
```

>We can also use language name to specify the language of the code block.
>Here is an example of a code block with a specified language:

```python
x=5+6
y= 8-3
z=4*5
a=x+y+z
print (z)
```

```R
x=5+6
y= 8-3
z=4*5
a=x+y+z
print (z)
```

# 11-Adding Tables

We can add tables in markdown by using the following syntax: | Column1 | Column2 | Column3 |

| species | petal_length | sepal_length |
| :----- | :-----: | -----: |
| setosa | 5.1 | 3.5 |
| setosa | 4.9 | 3.0 |
| setosa | 4.7 | 3.2 |

>To align the rows we use : --- for left, --- : for right and :---: for center alignment.
