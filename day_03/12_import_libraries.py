#some important statical libraries in python are numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels, scikit-learn, scipy, stats
#numpy is used for numerical operations, pandas for data manipulation, scipy for scientific and engineering applications,
#matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization, statsmodels for statistical modeling, scikit-learn for machine learning, stats for statistical functions
#pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis, it provides data structures and functions to efficiently handle structured data, including tabular data such as spreadsheets and SQL tables
#statsmodels is used for statistical modeling, it provides classes and functions for the estimation of statistical models, as well as classes and functions for the analysis of statistical models
#scikit-learn is used for machine learning, it provides simple and efficient tools for data analysis, which can also be used for machine learning tasks
